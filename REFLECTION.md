## **Reflection on Using AI Agents**

This project was my first time fully relying on AI tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude) to build both the backend and frontend of a complete system. Overall, the experience was very positive, and I learned how to work *with* AI instead of trying to make it do everything for me.

---

## **What I Learned**

### ⭐ 1. Clear prompts = better results

I realised that AI only works well when I explain exactly what I want.

Short prompts gave messy code, but detailed prompts produced clean and useful output.

### ⭐ 2. Each AI tool is good at different things

* **Cursor** helped with project structure and architecture.

* **Copilot** was great for small autocomplete tasks and boilerplate.

* **Claude** was the best for explaining logic and helping with complex functions.

Using the right tool for the right task saved a huge amount of time.

### ⭐ 3. AI is fast, but not perfect

AI agents made the project much faster, but they often missed:

* edge cases

* business rules

* correct TypeScript typing

So I still had to review everything carefully.

---

## **Efficiency Gains**

AI helped me:

* set up the project structure quickly

* write repetitive code faster

* generate React components and backend controllers

* explain complex logic like banking and pooling

It probably saved **15+ hours** of manual work.

But the important part is that **I stayed in control**, and AI handled the busywork.

## **What I Would Improve Next Time**

1. **Plan the architecture earlier** so AI has more context.

2. **Set coding standards from the beginning** to avoid style changes later.

3. **Write tests earlier**, possibly with the help of AI.

4. **Create reusable prompts**, especially for common patterns.

5. **Commit more often** after each AI-assisted feature.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

* AI is great for speeding up development, but it still needs human review.

* Good prompts matter more than anything else.

* AI helps most with structure, boilerplate, and refactoring.

* Complex business logic still requires manual thinking and corrections.

This project taught me how to work with AI in a balanced way—letting it handle the repetitive tasks while I focus on architecture, correctness, and understanding the domain.

---

## **Conclusion**

AI tools made this project faster, smoother, and more enjoyable.

But the best results came from combining AI speed with human judgment.

Going forward, I feel more confident using AI in real development work, and I now understand how to use it effectively—not as a replacement for my thinking, but as a powerful assistant.
